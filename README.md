# The odin admin dashboard

## An educational take on creataing a full fledged dashboard using CSS and HTML

Functionality is limited to surround the educational material of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)

## Description

The odin admin dashboard is a scratch-made admin dashboard, that has been made using the skills and knowledge attained from the current chapter I'm in, in The Odin Project.

I am to follow a design layout presented for the project and make it from scratch to fit as closely to the presented design as possible.

## What is involved?

The main purpose of the exercise is the practice the use of css grids. To that extend, I am limited to mainly use CSS grid to create the layout of the page, but that does not mean that I can't use flexbox at all.

This is, in essence, a practice in forming a website using CSS grid, and the constructive approach of doing so.

Furthermore, this is a great opportunity to experiment with the power of custom properties, setting a general color theme and other variables to streamline the overall look of the design.
